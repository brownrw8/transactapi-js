# TransactAPI Javascript SDK

This is a library for creating javascript wrapper functions for APIs as specified in the [documentation](https://api.norcapsecurities.com/admin_v3/documentation), provided by North Capital Private Securities (NCPS).

TransactAPI is a RESTful API that enables broker-dealers, funding platforms, and issuers to conduct online private securities offerings. Our standards-based API toolkit can be quickly and easily integrated with proprietary platforms, saving development time and money. Issuers, intermediaries, and advisors can benefit from TransactAPIâ€™s straight-through processing of private placement transactions, which enables higher transaction volumes, expands access to investors, and reduces processing times.

## Installation

```bash
npm install transactapi-js --save
yarn add transactapi-js
pnpm add transactapi-js
```
